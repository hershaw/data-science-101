# Detecting data problems

In this directory you will be learning how to detect some types of data problems.
As you will see in the presentation, defining what a data problem is can in itself
be problematic so use never stop thinking critically when using what you learn here!

## Concepts

### Masks

Although we try to keep the focus on data science rather than the tools, we won't
be able to escape needing to spend a bit of time talking about
[pandas masks](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.mask.html).

### Missing and repeated data

Learn how to find if you have missing entries in your tabular data.
This would be conceptually equivalent to having some cells with nothing
in them in an excel spreadsheet.

### Outliers

To grossly over-simplify, you can think of an outlier as "a datapoint
that just doesn't belong". However, this gets a bit thorny because
defining what it means for a datapoint to "not belong" can get quite subjective.

## Next steps

Enter the `examples` directory to open and run the notebooks in order.
When you are done, enter the `titanic` directory and run your own analysis
on the titanic dataset.
