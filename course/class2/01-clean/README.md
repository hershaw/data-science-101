# Cleaning your data

Now that you have some tools in your toolbelt to detect
some basic data problems, what will you do about it?

## Concepts

### Kill

You may decide that you don't want to get rid of rows that
contain missing data or that your outliers should be removed
from the dataset completely. In this case you will want to
get rid of it (or kill it if you're being dramatic)

### Impute

Maybe the data that you found to be missing our outliers are
fixable and you don't want to part with any of the data. In
this case, you can replace the missings our outliers with
values that are more representative of your population.

## Next steps

Enter the `example`s directory to open and run the notebooks in order. When you are done, enter the `titanic` directory and run your own analysis on the titanic dataset.
