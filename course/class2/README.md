# Class2 - Data Cleaning

In this class we will be looking at detecting data problems and cleaning your data. As in the previous class, we will provide some data and examples to demonstrate concepts, then you are expected to perform your own analysis on a new dataset.

## Structure

Similar to the previous class, each concept directory will contain an `examples` directory and a `titanic` directory. The `examples` directory contain code that will run (but has not been run yet). Run the code in these notebooks and feel free to mess around with it to help your understanding.

After you feel like you grasp the example code, go try it on a real-world dataset obtained from the titanic (yes we are talking about the big boat) [kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).

## Accessing the titanic data
Start a new notebook and put the following cell at the
top of your notebook:

```
from codefiles.class2 import get_titanic

data = get_titanic()
```

At this point, `data` will have a real-live titanic dataset that you will be ready to work on!

## Collaborate!

Work with each other and discuss your results. Don't be shy!


## Let's get started!

Enter the `00-detection` directory first and read the README. Then, repeat for the `01-clean` directory.
