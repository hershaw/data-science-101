## What are we doing here?

We are browsing sub-directories in order to create and run [jupyter notebooks](http://jupyter.org/).
Jupyter notebooks are great for proof-of-concept coding in python as well as several other languages.

## Jupyter notebook basics

You can [read here](http://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/Notebook/Notebook%20Basics.html)
about how to use jupyter notebooks but the most important thing to remember is:

- To execute the code in a cell, navigate to it and press `Shift-Enter`. That's Shift and Enter at the same time.

If you've followed the instructions in the main README, you should be able to open this directory
in your jupyter notebook browser and execute the cells in `test.ipynb`.

## Where to go from here

Check out the README in the `class1` directory.
